    <p> As of right now, organizations like Rivals.com hand out "national championships" to high school football teams which are even more made-up than college football's national championships.

      With each state holding multiple state championships (and some not at all), quite a few teams end up undefeated, and how can anyone possibly say who the "national champion" is?
      
      A national championship tournament may not be feasible, but how could a theoretical national championship work in a way that produces an indisputable national champion fairly and provides an exciting conclusion for the fans?</p>

    <p> High-achieving high school students in STEM often want to push themselves to conduct experiments, practice scientific communication, and compete in events that evaluate their work. Extracurricular science competitions can be a way for high schoolers to demonstrate exceptional merit and earn prestigious awards in STEM fields on top of their academic success at their schools.</p>
